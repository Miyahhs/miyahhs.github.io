## About

I’m a Computer Engineering student at NJIT, graduating early in Fall 2025. My interests live where hardware and software meet: embedded systems, digital design/FPGA (HDL/VHDL), and secure, efficient communication between them. I enjoy clean architectures, readable code, and experiments that turn into real features.
Off the track and in the lab is how I work now, but I carry my D1 track & field mindset into engineering—consistent training, data-driven progress, and delivering on meet day. I’m exploring roles where I can contribute to low-level systems, help optimize performance, and keep learning in public through well-written docs and demos. If that sounds like your team, let’s connect!
